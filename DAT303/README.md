This hands-on workshop, aimed at developers and solution builders, introduces how to leverage foundation models (FMs) through Amazon Bedrock while using Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition with the pgvector extension as the vector database.

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to FMs from third-party providers and Amazon; available via an API. With Bedrock, you can choose from a variety of models to find the one thatâ€™s best suited for your use case. Amazon Aurora is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. 

Within this series of labs, you'll explore some of the most common usage patterns we are seeing with our customers for Generative AI. We will show techniques for similarity search and natural language text and processing, creating value for organizations by improving productivity. This is achieved by leveraging foundation models to help in summarizing text, answering questions, building chatbots, and product recommendations. You will gain hands-on experience implementing these patterns via Bedrock APIs, as well as open-source software like LangChain and pgvector.

Labs include:

- Product Recommendations
- Question Answering with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Response Streaming with RAG
